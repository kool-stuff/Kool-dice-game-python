# Kool-dice-game-python
First python code I've done in years, decided to try again. This is a simple script that will prompt user if they want to roll 2 dices. If used says yes, dices are rolled, otherwise game ends.


ISSUES THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED:
FOR NOW, THE INPUT ACCEPTS GIBBERISH CONTAINING y or n INSIDE THE STRING REGARDLESS OF CONTEXT (e.g. hgfjjhgfyn is considered as a yes since there is a y), PLEASE FIX LATER IF POSSIBLE
